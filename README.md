# NaNoGenMo 2016

My 2016 entry for the yearly [National Novel Generation Month](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2016).

I'd like to start off with a simple concept where each day the code writes the days of the month i.e. today it will write "One" 1,666 times.

As often as possible, during this month I'd like to improve on the generation. My initial idea was to add patterns that make the text look like novel, except written in some mysterious code (cryptography rather than my programming style) e.g.

> One, "one one?".
> "One..."
> "One!!?!"

I'll keep updating the issue as I come up with new ideas.
